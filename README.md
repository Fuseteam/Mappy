A Resource-finding Android Application
This is application that allows one to search for points of interest that are close to the user
The goal is to eventually implement in such a way that users can contribute points of interest to the application to share with others
This way a up to date map of points of interest can be maintains by the community for the community

one usecase is: a user is on the street and want to know what where the closest bank is
one can then just select the bank catergorie and it will find the closest bank to the user
